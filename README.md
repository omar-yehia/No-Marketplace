# No-Marketplace
(Chrome Extension)

2019 Omar Yehia

Facebook hompage has many sections on the side.
One of them is the marketplace section,
which (at least here in Egypt) usualy displays images of tight womensware.
Repetitive and irretating ads like this made me want to solve this problem.
The solution was this Chrome Extension that enables you to hide/show those sections as you want.

You can use the code under MIT License, in short, you can do whatever you want with the code, provided that you include the license as it is with your code.
